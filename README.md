## Environment
 - Install Anaconda Python3.7
 - This code is tested on NVIDIA V100 GPU with 16GB memory
 
``` 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
 - Please download the [PF-PASCAL](http://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/proposalflow/dataset/PF-dataset-PASCAL.zip), [PF-WILLOW](http://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/proposalflow/dataset/PF-dataset.zip), [TSS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-VxeI7PlJE1U3FyTGVpbUFtcjg/view?usp=sharing), and [Internet](http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/ObjectDiscovery/ObjectDiscovery-data.zip) datasets
 - Please modify the variable `DATASET_DIR` in `config.py` 
 - Please modify the variable `CSV_DIR` in `config.py`



## Training
 - You may determine which dataset to be the `training set` by changing the $DATASET variable in train.sh
 - You may change the $BATCH_SIZE variable in `train.sh` to a suitable value based on the GPU memory
 - The trained model will be saved under the `trained_models` folder
 
``` 
sh train.sh
```


## Evaluation
 - You may determine which dataset to be evaluated by changing the $DATASET variable in eval.sh
 - You may change the $BATCH_SIZE variable in `eval.sh` to a suitable value based on the GPU memory
 
``` 
sh eval.sh
```
